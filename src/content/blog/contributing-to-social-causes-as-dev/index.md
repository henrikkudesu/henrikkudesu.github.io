_I’m writing this post especially for developers at the beginning of their careers, but it can also be valuable for professionals at any level._

Around the world, there are countless non-profit social organizations, such as NGOs, Civil Society Organizations, Charity Associations, and other groups working in various fields. They play an essential role in society, helping minorities, underprivileged groups, the environment, war victims, people with disabilities, elderly individuals in vulnerable situations, isolated rural communities, and even promoting public education and healthcare. Many times, we want to contribute to these causes, but the sheer number of organizations available makes it hard to decide which one to support. However, the solution is simpler than it seems: just choose a cause that resonates with you and make your contribution, even if it’s small. That alone will be enough to create a positive impact. I believe that, as citizens, we have a responsibility to lend a hand to those in need.

## How to Help Even If You Don’t Have Financial Resources?

As developers, we can engage in volunteer projects to help NGOs build and maintain their online portals. There are several websites that connect these organizations with volunteers, listing the services they periodically need.

For example, I came across the site [Freehelper](https://www.freehelper.org), a platform that connects volunteers with NGOs and institutions in need of technical support, graphic design, web development, and more. After signing up on the site, I started receiving emails with opportunities for volunteer actions. This year, I had the chance to contribute to the INESP Civil Society Organization (Institutes of Public Performances of Brazil), where I was asked to create and optimize their **[online portal](https://www.inespbrasil.site/)**. Building the website was straightforward: I used WordPress, set up the hosting, and voilà, the site is now live and functional.

This is just a small example of how you can contribute to social causes directly from your home, with a bit of effort and dedication. However, it’s important to believe in what you’re doing and understand that it will impact lives and the society we are part of. As I’ve already said, we have this responsibility.

## What Volunteer Platforms Are Out There?

There are many platforms dedicated to connecting volunteers with social causes. Below, I list some of them, organized by region:

### In Brazil:

- **[Freehelper](https://www.freehelper.com.br)**: A platform that connects volunteers with NGOs and institutions in need of technical support, graphic design, web development, and other skills.
- **[Atados](https://www.atados.com.br)**: A website offering volunteer opportunities in various areas, from technology to in-person activities.

## What Can You Learn From This?

The lessons I learned from participating in these volunteer actions go beyond social impact and significantly contributed to my growth as a developer. During this first project, I learned:

- How to deal with real clients
- How to interpret and prioritize requirements
- MVP (Minimum Viable Product) delivery
- How to handle requirement changes during the process
- Hosting setup and management
- Practical work with WordPress
- How to listen to feedback and reports constructively

For me, it was an incredible experience where I felt fulfilled for contributing socially while also improving my technical skills.

You can – and should – do this too, especially if you’re just starting your career as a web developer. I hope this post is helpful and inspires you to find ways to take on more personal projects while making a difference in the world.
