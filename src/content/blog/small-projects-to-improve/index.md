Practicing with real-world projects is one of the best ways to enhance your programming skills. Frontend Mentor is a great platform that provides design challenges based on real-world scenarios, helping developers sharpen their skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

In <a href="https://github.com/henrikkudesu/frontendmentor-challenges" target="_blank">my repository</a>, I have completed various projects that helped me improve my coding abilities. Here are some examples:

### üìå 3-Column Preview Card Component

This project focuses on building a responsive layout using CSS Flexbox and Grid to arrange content in three columns.

### üé≠ Advice Generator App

An interactive application that fetches data from an external API to generate random advice, improving asynchronous JavaScript skills and DOM manipulation.

### üìÖ Age Calculator App

A simple yet effective challenge that calculates age based on the user‚Äôs input, reinforcing form handling and input validation in JavaScript.

### üì∞ Article Preview Component

This project enhances interactivity, displaying an article preview with a toggle effect, emphasizing event handling and JavaScript logic.

### üì© Newsletter Sign-Up Form with Success Message

A form validation challenge where users enter their email, and upon successful submission, a confirmation message appears, improving user experience and feedback mechanisms.

### üåç REST Countries App

This project was a great learning experience in consuming REST APIs and state management. It displays country information, allows searching, filtering, and toggling between light and dark mode. I worked extensively with React, TailwindCSS, and API integration.

### Why Small Projects Matter?

Working on these small projects allows you to practice key coding concepts, build problem-solving skills, and refine UI/UX design implementation. Plus, Frontend Mentor offers a great way to compare your solutions with others, helping you learn different approaches and best practices.
